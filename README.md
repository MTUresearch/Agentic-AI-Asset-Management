# Agentic-AI-Asset-Management
Transportation agencies increasingly rely on data-driven models for pavement condition forecasting; however, existing artificial intelligence (AI) approaches remain largely confined to static, human-centric analytical pipelines. This study proposes an Agentic AI framework that reframes pavement condition analytics as an autonomous, multi-agent reasoning process. The framework integrates role-specialized large language model agents including a Planner, Pavement Engineer, Data Scientist, Coder, and Reviewer operating under a hybrid retrieval-augmented memory that enables contextual reasoning, analytical governance, and traceable execution. Using HPMS data, the framework is demonstrated through two real-world case studies representing maintenance and no-maintenance scenarios. Results show that the agentic system autonomously constructs end-to-end analytical pipelines, encompassing exploratory analysis, target discovery, model development, and evaluation, while achieving predictive performance comparable to expert-crafted human implementations. Beyond predictive accuracy, the proposed framework reduces reliance on manual analytical workflows while preserving transparency, reproducibility, and human oversight, offering a scalable paradigm for next-generation infrastructure asset management.
